1. Background & Eligibility
Midnight is a new privacy-first blockchain closely linked to Cardano but operating as its own chain, with “NIGHT” as its native utility token.

Eligibility: Users holding minimum $100 equivalent in any of these tokens as of snapshot date June 11, 2024 (midnight UTC) are eligible:

ADA, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, AVAX, SOL, BAT.

Note: ADA receives 50% of airdrop; BTC 20%; other chains split the remaining 30%.

What wallets qualify?
Self-custody wallets (hardware or hot wallets) where you control the private keys.

Exchanges or custodial wallets: Not eligible unless the custodian opts to participate and redistributes the airdrop to clients. Most will not.

If you are using an institutional staking provider (e.g., Lido for ETH), only the custodian can claim unless they create a mechanism for clients to receive airdrops.

2. Key Claim Phases and Deadlines
Phase 1: Glacier Drop Claim (main airdrop): 60 days window to claim. Unclaimed tokens go to phase 2.

Phase 2: Scavenger Mine: Next 30 days, unclaimed tokens become claimable by other users and network participants.

Phase 3: Lost & Found: Original claimants who missed the 60-day window have up to 4 years (via direct smart contract interaction) to claim a fraction of their original allocation.

Vesting (“Thawing”): NIGHT tokens are locked at first, and unlock (“thaw”) in 4 equal installments over ~360 days (first unlock is randomly assigned between day 1-90).

3. Claiming Process: Step-by-Step
A. Preparation
Confirm Eligibility:

ADA, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, AVAX, SOL, or BAT held in a self-custody wallet as of June 11, 2024 snapshot.

For ADA: 50% of the NIGHT airdrop is reserved for Cardano holders.

Prepare Your Wallet(s):

Use a wallet you control (hardware wallets: Ledger, Trezor, etc.; hot wallets: Nami, Eternl, Yoroi, Daedalus, etc.).

Exchanges and custodians: Not eligible unless they create special claiming mechanisms.

Create a New Cardano Wallet for Redemption (Privacy Best Practice):

Best practice: Use a brand new, unused Cardano wallet address for receiving NIGHT tokens.

This helps keep your NIGHT holdings private and not linked to prior ADA transactions.

Unused address = no transaction history at the time of claim.

B. Using the Official Portal
Go to the Official Claim Portal:

https://www.midnight.gd/how-to-get-night

Beware of phishing! Only use official links from Midnight or Cardano announcements.

Connect Your Origin Wallet:

Select your blockchain and wallet (e.g., ADA via Eternal, BTC via supported wallets, etc.).

The portal will prompt you to connect and sign a message or transaction to prove ownership.

Do not enter your seed phrase—sign only the wallet prompt.

Specify a Destination Address:

For Cardano: Enter the new, unused ADA address you created (step 3) as your NIGHT token destination.

Double-check the address, as this is where your NIGHT tokens will be sent after vesting.

Review & Confirm:

The portal will display your eligible NIGHT allocation (based on snapshot and official formula).

Review and confirm the claim.

Record and Backup:

Record your claim confirmation and note any transaction IDs or portal confirmations.

Securely store your new redemption wallet’s seed phrase (for future access to NIGHT).

C. Vesting, Redemption, and Unlocks
Understand the Vesting Schedule (“Thawing”):

NIGHT tokens unlock in four installments (25% each).

First unlock date is randomly assigned within 1–90 days after claim; subsequent unlocks every 90 days.

You may redeem each installment as it unlocks, or wait and redeem later.

Each redemption is a Cardano transaction—small ADA fee required.

Redemption Window:

You have a 90-day grace period after the last installment unlocks to redeem all tokens.

The claim portal remains available throughout this period.

4. If You Miss the Claim
Scavenger Mine: Unclaimed NIGHT goes into a pool available to new claimants (anyone can join) for the next 30 days.

Lost & Found: Original claimants who missed both the main and scavenger phases have up to four years to interact with the Midnight smart contract and claim a fraction of their original entitlement (requires technical know-how if portal is unavailable).

5. Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Are exchange balances eligible?
A: No, unless your exchange explicitly supports the airdrop (rare).

Q: Can I use a hardware wallet?
A: Yes—so long as you control the private key and can sign transactions with it. If using Daedalus, you can restore your wallet in Eternal or Yoroi to claim.

Q: Do I need to pay or do KYC?
A: No, the process is free (other than standard Cardano transaction fees), and does not require KYC.

Q: Why use an unused ADA address?
A: Protects your privacy by preventing linkability between your NIGHT holdings and prior Cardano activity.

Q: How is my NIGHT allocation calculated?
A:
For ADA:
N = (Your ADA at snapshot / Total eligible ADA at snapshot) × 12,000,000,000 NIGHT
(e.g., with 1,000 ADA out of 14.7B total, you’d receive ≈ 816.44 NIGHT).

Q: What if I miss the window?
A: You can still claim a fraction of your tokens in “Lost & Found” phase (within four years), but it’s much smaller than in the main window.

6. Tips for Agents Guiding Users
Always verify the user’s eligibility (self-custody, snapshot, minimum amount).

Always remind about phishing risks and to use only official portals.

Prompt the user to create a brand new Cardano wallet address for privacy.

Walk users step-by-step through wallet connection and signature, never asking for seed phrases.

Explain the vesting/thawing schedule so users don’t expect immediate liquidity.

If users are on exchanges or custodians, clarify that only the service provider can claim, and it is rare for them to do so.

Encourage users to act within the 60-day window, but mention the scavenger/lost & found safety nets for latecomers (with reduced reward).
