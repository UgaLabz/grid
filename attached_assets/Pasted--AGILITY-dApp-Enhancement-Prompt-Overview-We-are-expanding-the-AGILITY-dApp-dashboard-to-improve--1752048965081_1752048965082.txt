 AGILITY dApp – Enhancement Prompt
Overview:
We are expanding the AGILITY dApp dashboard to improve usability, privacy control, and modularity. Integrate the following 7 enhancements, using our existing black/yellow/white design system and maintaining full compatibility with XRPL, ZKPs, and Web3 domains.

🧩 Enhancements to Add:
1. 🔐 Privacy Mode Toggle
Add a toggle switch labeled Privacy Mode in the top-right corner.

When active:

Add optional keyboard shortcut Shift + P to toggle.

2. 💬 Activity Feed Filter
Add dropdown filters to the Recent Activity section:

All, Sent, Received, Domains

Date range selector: Last 7d, 30d, Custom

Amount filter (min/max)

3. 🪪 Wallet Identity Profiles
For each owned or interacted-with domain:

Add small profile icon to open a modal:

Domain avatar (IPFS image)

Domain nickname

User-defined tags (e.g., “Vendor”, “Friend”)

Optional “Notes” textarea

🧱 Implementation Notes:
Use TailwindCSS (same spacing/rounded/buttons as existing site).

Maintain mobile responsiveness.

Keep AGILITY logo and sidebar always visible on all sections.

Use yellow for key highlights, toggle on hover.

All icons should match current style (remix or lucide icon pack preferred).

Ensure any placeholder “coming soon” areas are styled like current "Restricted Access" view.
