 Let's build a third main page for the GRID platform called "Services".

🧠 Purpose: This page will showcase the services GRID offers, including packages, add-ons, and a la carte options. It must reflect a premium, modern Web3 design.

🧩 PAGE STRUCTURE:
1. Nav Bar

Add a new tab to the navigation called Services

Highlighted when on this page

2. Hero Section (Top of Services Page)

Full width with dark grey → black gradient

Title: "Crafted Services for Builders, Degens & Visionaries"

Subtext: “Launch-ready websites, AI-powered videos, branding, memetics, and more — tailor your stack.”

Optionally include a 3D-style render of a service-related element, floating/glowing on the right (use subtle jungle yellow glow)

Maintain current dark grey/black/yellow aesthetic (no gradients like purple or neon)

Use sleek shadows, slight neon-style glow on hover

Layout and inspiration should follow the Lunar and Avangard examples, but stay true to GRID’s cyberpunk, professional look
