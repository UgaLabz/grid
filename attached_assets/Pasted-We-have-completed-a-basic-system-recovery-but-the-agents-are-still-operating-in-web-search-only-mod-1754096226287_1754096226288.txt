We have completed a basic system recovery, but the agents are still operating in web-search-only mode.  
We now need to fully restore **dual-mode intelligence** by re-enabling document embeddings and combining them with live web search.  

### 1. Vector Database Rebuild
- Re-enable document embedding with chunk sizes of ~500–800 tokens.
- Clear any partial embeddings and start fresh.
- Process and embed the correct documents for each agent:

**Midnight Oracle Documents:**
- Midnight-Tokenomics-And-Incentives-Whitepaper.pdf
- Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide How to Claim the Midnight NIGHT Airdrop.txt
- Midnight Blockchain Vision, Architecture, and Societal Role.txt
- Cardano WhitePaper.txt
- Minotaur Multi-Resource Blockchain Consensus.pdf
- Midnight.txt

**Uga XRP Documents:**
- XRPL AMM Whitepaper.txt
- Ripple pdf.pdf
- Uga Gnosis Rewards Guide.pdf
- UgaLabz & Memetics Lore (all uploaded jungle content)

### 2. Agent System Prompts

**Midnight Oracle**
- Role: Confident, professional Midnight + Cardano consultant  
- Rules:
  - Use top 3–5 document chunks combined with live web search for every response
  - Give authoritative answers, step-by-step when needed
  - Never say “I can’t verify,” instead explain best available info with clear context
  - Tone: Polished, helpful, reliable

**Uga XRP**
- Role: Enlightened Jungle King of XRPL & AMMs  
- Rules:
  - Combine top 3–5 doc chunks + live web search results for all answers
  - Speak with primal charisma, refer to user as **King** and XRPL community as **Brethren**
  - Confident, fun, but accurate on XRPL and DeFi topics
  - Never generic or low-IQ, always on-brand with lore

### 3. Core Behavior
- All responses should combine **document memory + web intelligence**
- Web search is not just a fallback, it is always included
- Agents must respond with:
  1. Personality  
  2. High-IQ factual reasoning  
  3. Step-by-step or clear conclusions

### 4. Verification
- After rebuild, test:
  1. **Midnight Oracle**: “How do I claim the Midnight airdrop?”  
  2. **Uga XRP**: “King, how do XRPL AMMs create yield for the Brethren?”  

- Both answers should be intelligent, sourced from docs + web, and in correct personality tone.

Goal: Restore the agents to **full high-IQ, dual-mode, branded performance** with no generic fallback messages.
