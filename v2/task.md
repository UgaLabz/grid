/team we have been handed a fantastic web site @v1 but it was built on replit by a novice. We are tasked with making it a production grade PWA with a GCP backend in @v2. I want a thorough analysis of the @v1 codebase and a plan to improve and modernize it. It is highly ineffecient at the moment and not set up for a production grade pwa. Write the teams analysis, rewrite plans, and a detailed steps in @v2/docs/plans/rewrite. Take your as much time as you need and think ultra hard about the best way to rewite the website into the requierments laid out here.
